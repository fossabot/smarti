=== Release

For a release, a release branch (based on develop) is created which represents the release candidate.
If the candidate fulfills the requirements, the issues of the release are documented in the changelogs.
Then the version number is set to the release number, the branch is merged into master and the master is tagged with the release number.
Additionally, the version number of the develop branch is set to the new snapshot version.
